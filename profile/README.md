## About Motive

**Motive** is a closed social media app designed to connect friends through personalized challenges. Users can send these "motives" to their friends within groups, where they complete the challenge by capturing a photo. Each motive contains an objective — typically something like taking a picture with or of a specific item or scenario. For example, a motive could be: "Take a picture with a beer in your hand!"

With Motive, social interactions become more creative and engaging—perfect for parties or casual get-togethers. Whether it’s a funny task or a meaningful challenge, Motive lets you connect with friends in a fun, private space, making every moment more interactive and memorable.
